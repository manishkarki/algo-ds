    /**
     * Given an unsorted array of integers, find a subarray which adds to a given number. If there are more than one subarrays with the sum as the given number, print any of them.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5}, sum = 33
     * Output: Sum found between indexes 2 and 4
     * Explanation: Sum of elements between indices
     * 2 and 4 is 20 + 3 + 10 = 33
     *
     * Input: arr[] = {10, 2, -2, -20, 10}, sum = -10
     * Output: Sum found between indexes 0 to 3
     * Explanation: Sum of elements between indices
     * 0 and 3 is 10 + 2 - 2 - 20 = -10
     *
     * Input: arr[] = {-10, 0, 2, -2, -20, 10}, sum = 20
     * Output: No subarray with given sum exists
     * Explanation: There is no subarray with the given sum
